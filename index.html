                Team Infamy is a team of three developers from the Dallas, Texas area.  They entered <a href="https://koding.com/Hackathon" target="_blank"> Koding.com's hackathon</a>.
                The themes they chose to hack towards was creating an educational game that also taught some basics of programming.  Using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and various libraries they
                embarked on their endeavor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main idea behind Hello Sound is to teach some basic object oriented programming fundamentals in a fun way.  The app is a single page website where a user can
                write some cde in a console. This code can create objects that represent musical notes, notation, sounds, etc.  Using HTML's canvas element a graphical view of their object is presented.  An audio
                representation is also available.  This app is currently in alpha stage.  Future goals are to have the ability to print music composed to pdf (sheet music), export audio to various formats / cloud
                services, and to make it fully mobile friendly for use in a tablet.
            </p>

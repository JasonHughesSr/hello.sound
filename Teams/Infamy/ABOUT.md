#Team Infamy
================

We are calling our team (project) Infamy.  The name is because the final day of the competition is "a date which will live in infamy".  One of us loves history, and geography.  One of us is a movie buff.  One of us really enjoys learning design patterns, really.

##Team Info

Team Infamy is a team of three developers from the Dallas, Texas area.  They entered Koding.com's hackathon.

 extra layer of the user experience.

##Project Info
The main idea behind Hello Sound is to teach some basic object oriented programming fundamentals in a fun way.  The app is a single page website where a user can
write some cde in a console. This code can create objects that represent musical notes, notation, sounds, etc.  Using HTML's canvas element a graphical view of their object is presented.  An audio
representation is also available.  This app is currently in alpha stage.  Future goals are to have the ability to print music composed to pdf (sheet music), export audio to various formats / cloud
services, and to make it fully mobile friendly for use in a tablet.
